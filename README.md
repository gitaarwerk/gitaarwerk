# 👋 Hi, I’m @gitaarwerk (🎸👷)

I'm [Jordy](https://www.spacecorp.nl/), a passionate developer from Leiden, the Netherlands. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## Please sponsor my project Gleamy, a shiney component library, and help make the internet less boring:

## 🔧 Technologies
I'm mainly a front-end developer, but I rather be just called, a developer. Because a language is just a tool to get something done. But languages/technologies I do are:
Expert: JavaScript, React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, CI/CD, 
Advanced: HTML5 Canvas, (PL/My/No/etc)SQL, LUA, PHP7, (Front-end) cyber security
Mid-level: Linux, Networking
Noob level: C++, Electornics, Microprocessors, systems hacking

## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning, in any ordeer and switching whenever I feel like
- Offensive hacking (you need to break things in order to make things)
- C++ for embedded systems (arduino, pico pi; because it's fun!)
- HTML5 Canvas & Mathematics (As I never focussed on this, and math is fun)
- Learning to play piano & guitar (to get away from the computer every so often)
