# 👋 Hi, I’m @gitaarwerk (🎸👷)

I'm a passionate developer from Leiden, the Netherlands.

## Please sponsor my project Gleamy, a shiney component library, and help make the internet less boring:
Have you ever heard of Gleamy? It's that cool effect stuff that you had on wrapping paper, business cards,... BUT THEN ON YOUR WEBSITE!
And you know what? I'ts **FREE** and **OPEN SOURCE!**. You can make your logo shine, or add a dash of luxury to your site/app.

Try it out at https://gleamy.dev/

## 🔧 Technologies
I'm mainly a front-end developer, but I rather be just called, a developer. Because a language is just a tool to get something done. But languages/technologies I do are:
Expert: JavaScript, React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, CI/CD, 
Advanced: HTML5 Canvas, (PL/My/No/etc)SQL, LUA, PHP7, (Front-end) cyber security
Mid-level: Linux, Networking
Noob level: C++, Electornics, Microprocessors, systems hacking

## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning, in any ordeer and switching whenever I feel like
- Offensive hacking (you need to break things in order to make things)
- Languages for embedded systems (arduino, pico pi, ESP32; because it's fun!)
- HTML5 Canvas & Mathematics (As I never focussed on this, and math is fun)
- Learning to play piano & guitar (to get away from the computer every so often)
